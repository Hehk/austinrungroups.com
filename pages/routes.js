        <H3>The Town Lake Loop</H3>
        <P>
          The loop, is a mostly dirt route that goes along the Colorado river
          through downtown Austin. It is the most popular route by far in
          Austin, and most long run groups at least do a section of their run on
          it.

        <H3>Mt Bonnell</H3>
        <P>
          You can run from downtown to the top of Mt Bonnell, and back. It is a
          great route if you are up for hills. Overall the route will take about
          10 miles, and will end you back on the Town Lake Loop.

        <P>
          The greenbelt is a 10 mile loop that goes around the city of Austin.
          It is mostly paved, but there are some dirt sections. It is a great
          place to run, and there are many groups that run it.
        </P>
        <P>
          There are multiple entry points, parking at Barton Springs Pool and
          Barton Creek Greenbelt Trailhead are the easiest.
