        This website was created by Kyle Henderson. I am the guy with a border
        collie named Greg.

        This whole website builds off a spreadsheet linked above. I am going to
        setup a kyle@austinrungroups.com email but if you need to get in contact
        with me quickly, I am usually at ESBR and sometimes are Morning
        Jo&apos;s.
